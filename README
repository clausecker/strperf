String Benchmark Code
=====================

This repository contains code to benchmark libc string functions for
FreeBSD.  The benchmarks are designed to have the same conventions and
output formats provided by Go's benchmarks and can be analysed with the
same tooling (benchstat from devel/go-perf).

This work was created under FreeBSD Foundation sponsorship.
